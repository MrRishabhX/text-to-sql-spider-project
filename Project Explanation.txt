The exponential growth of data-driven applications has made databases integral to modern software systems, yet extracting meaningful information typically requires SQL proficiency, creating barriers for non-technical users. This dissertation presents the successful implementation of a Natural Language to SQL Query Generator for Custom Databases that enables users to interact with relational databases using natural language queries in English.
The system addresses the core challenge of interpreting varied natural language inputs and translating them into structured queries compatible with custom database schemas. Our solution integrates advanced techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and database systems using a comprehensive technology stack.
Development Environment and Tools: The system was developed using Google Colab for model training and experimentation, MySQL Workbench for database design and management, and VS Code for application development. The frontend was implemented using Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for real-time query processing
